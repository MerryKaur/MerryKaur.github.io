<div class="shrine_text">
There are many delicious types of food to eat in Japan! It's fun to try them all.<br>
Here are a few of my favorite dishes:<br>
<img class="pic" src="sushi.JPG" onClick="openWindow('sushi.JPG')"><br>
When many people hear the word "sushi" they think of raw fish, but many kinds of sushi don't contain fish at all!<br>
The word "sushi" is referring to the vinegar rice, and sushi can be served with cooked fish, and even no fish at all!<br>
Many sushi restaurants in Japan are "kaiten-zushi", which means "conveyor belt" sushi. <br>
These restaurants serve plates of sushi that are delivered to tables on a conveyor belt that loops around the restaurant.<br>
You can often order other dishes, like soup, tempura, or dessert.<br>
<br><br>
<img class="pic" src="yakiniku.JPG" onClick="openWindow('yakiniku.JPG')"><br>
"Yaki" means grill and "niku" means meat, so "yakiniku" is a restaurant where you can eat grilled meat.<br>
Yakiniku restaurants are fun to visit with friends.<br>
You sit at a table with a charcoal grill in the center, and cook your food together.<br>
You can order many types of meat, seafood, and even veggies.<br>
<br>
<img class="pic" src="soba-tempura.JPG" onClick="openWindow('soba-tempura.JPG')"><br>
"Soba" is a special type of noodle made from buckwheat.<br>
It's common to eat soba cold in the summer, and often served together with tempura.<br>
It is traditional to eat soba on New Year's Eve, called "Toshikoshi soba". <br><br>
<img class="pic" src="yakisoba.JPG" onClick="openWindow('yakisoba.JPG')"><br>
Another popular way to eat soba is "yakisoba", which is grilled soba noodles.<br>
The soba noodles are sauteed with veggies and meat, and often come with an egg on top.<br>
This dish is often sold from vendors at festivals, and it's a popular dish in the Kansai region.<br>
<img class="pic" src="taiyaki.JPG" onClick="openWindow('taiyaki.JPG')"><br>
A special snack or dessert is a pastry shaped like a fish, called "taiyaki".<br>
The outer layer is similar to pancake or waffle batter.<br>
Traditionally it is filled with sweet red bean paste.<br>
You can also find taiyaki with chocolate or even stuffed like a sandwich.<br>
They are popular 'street vendor' food and often served at markets and festivals.<br><br>
<img class="pic" src="curry.JPG" onClick="openWindow('curry.JPG')"><br>
Curry restaurants are very common in Japan.<br>
Japanese curry is traditionally made with carrots, potatos, and beef.<br>
Some people like to have an egg in their curry!<br>
Other popular toppings are fried kabocha squash, cutlet, or pickled vegetables.<br><br>
<img class="pic" src="shrine-meal.JPG" onClick="openWindow('shrine-meal.JPG')"><br>
"Shojin Ryori" is the traditional food of Buddhist monks in Japan. <br>
It is made without meat, fish, or animal products.<br>
You can eat a meal like this at some temples, and a few specialty restaurants also. <br><br>
<img class="pic" src="katsu.JPG" onClick="openWindow('katsu.JPG')"><br>
"Katsu" is a breaded and fried cutlet, usually pork or chicken. <br>
It is often served with curry.<br>
It is eaten with 'tonkotsu sauce', a sweet brown sauce made from pureed fruit. <br><br>
<img class="pic" src="oyakodon.JPG" onClick="openWindow('oyakodon.JPG')"><br>
"Donburi" means bowl, and is a type of food served in a bowl with rice and other ingredients.<br>
It's commonly abbreviated as 'don' and used in connection with other words to describe the dish.<br>
For example, 'gyÅ«don' is a dish with beef and rice, and 'katsudon' is a dish with katsu and rice.<br>
My favorite type is 'oyakodon', which is sauteed chicken, eggs, and onions, served over rice.<br><br>
<img class="pic" src="yakitori.JPG" onClick="openWindow('yakitori.JPG')"><br>
"Yakitori" means grilled chicken, and it is served on small bamboo skewers. <br>
It is often sold at festivals and by street vendors.<br>
There are many varieties of yakitori made with different meats, and even some with only vegetables!<br><br>
