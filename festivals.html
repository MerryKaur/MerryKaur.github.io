There are festivals throughout the year in Japan. Some are small and celebrated locally, and some are larger.<br>
Some festivals are sponsored by a local shrine or temple, or put on by a city.<br>
The Japanese word for festival is 'matsuri' and often has events such as a procession and dancing.<br>
Festivals generally have vendors selling food and trinkets, and stalls with games.<br><br>

 <br>
A popular time to travel to Japan is during the spring, in order to see the cherry blossoms.<br>
In Japan, 'hanami' means 'blossom viewing' and many areas have their own 'sakura matsuri', or cherry blossom festival.<br>
Often held in parks or open areas with many cherry trees nearby, people like to set up picnics and sit under the blossoming trees.<br>
Many vendors set up stands to sell food, and people like to drink and play badminton.<br><br>
<img class="pic" src="tanabata.JPG" onClick="openWindow('tanabata.JPG')"><br>
Tanabata, sometimes called the 'star festival', is a celebration that happens in July or August.<br>
It is traditional to write a wish for the upcoming year, then hang it on bamboo.<br>
The bamboo is displayed with other decorations, and is very colorful.<br>
There are usually 'decorating contests', where groups like businesses or schools make a tanabata display for their building.<br><br>
<img class="pic" src="ome-azaleas.JPG" onClick="openWindow('ome-azaleas.JPG')"><br>
When the azaleas begin blooming in Japan, from April to May, there is a festival held at Shiofune Kannon temple in Ome.<br>
It is said that there are over 20,000 azaleas planted on the surrounding hills, and the brilliant pink, red, white, and purple blossoms are spectacular.<br>
You can walk along trails in the hills directly among the azalea bushes, and there are some small food stalls and souvenir booths.<br><br>
<img class="pic" src="fireworks.JPG" onClick="openWindow('fireworks.JPG')"><br>
Every weekend starting in June, you can find a "natsu matsuri" or summer festival happening somewhere nearby.<br>
They don't have a certain date, but take place throughout the summer and usually are put on by the city or some regional group.<br>
People wear a traditional robe, a 'yukata', and enjoy picnics in the grass with family and friends.<br>
During the day you can eat shaved ice and takoyaki, and there can be performances like traditional dancing and taiyo drumming.<br>
At night there is a big fireworks show!<br><br>
